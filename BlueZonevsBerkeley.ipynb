    "##### Blue Zones are areas of the world where people live much longer than the rest of the population and there are only 5 Blue Zones in the world in countries such as Greece, Italy, Japan, USA, and Costa Rica. The longevity of the population is a reflection of the their culture, community, and most importantly diets since they all tend to lead healthy lifestyles. \n",
    "##### Our group wants to see how feasible it would be to eat a Blue Zone diet as Berkeley students as compared to our typical diets. To do this, we are testing a typical Mediterranean diet, eaten in Ikaria, Greece, and an Okinawa, Japan diet against a typical Berkeley student's diet to see which has the lowest price (with Berkeley Safeway prices) and most nutritional value."
