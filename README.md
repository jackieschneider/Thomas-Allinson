Tried helping out by making the ReadMe.MD and code review and code that many people seemed to like/appreciate in the overral reviews but nevermind yall are weirdos...

The term “Blue Zones” refers to five areas across the world where the population consistently exceeds the average life expectancy. While this is due to a combination of factors including activity level and sense of community, a large component is their diets.  

Our goal for this project was to compare the minimum  costs of two diets from Blue Zones to the diet of a typical UC Berkeley student. We wanted to find out if these diets are doable for a student on a budget who primarily shops at Safeway.  






- Our control diet was based on responses from students and had no dietary restrictions, the least cost diet was built from a list of several ingredients available at the Berkeley Safeway and focused on achieving the daily minimum nutritional requirements at the cheapest cost without any restrictions on grocery items. 

- The Okinawa diet was built based on a blue zone diet from Okinawa, Japan. To build the least cost version of this we used a limited list of grocery items from Safeway based on restrictions imposed by the Okinawa diet. In addition to these restrictions we also added certain items that were not very common but often used in this diet.

- The Mediterranean diet was built based on a blue zone diet from Ikaria, Greece and Sardinia, Italy. Similar to the Okinawa diet we added some restrictions on the items that could be used to build the lowest cost version of this diet and also added certain commonly used items.
